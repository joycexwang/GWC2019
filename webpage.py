Joyceâ€™s Travel Blog 

Bio:

I am a girl who codes from Basking Ridge, NJ. I attend Newark Academy and will be in the 12th grade this fall. I live at home with my mom, my dad, and my younger sister Jolene. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, watching TV, and of course travelling.

Santa Barbara, California: I love a great science fiction novel. Right now I am reading The Three Body Problem, by Cixin Liu.

Puerto Rico: I really don't like fish. They have dead eyes that freak me out!

: So far, I've been to 4 different continents! I can't wait to see the others.

Favorite Websites:
New York Times: I like to stay up to date, and to do the crosswords!
xkcd.com: A great internet comic
Tumblr: I love the pictures that people I follow post.

Side Scroller Project:

Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!
