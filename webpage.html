<P>
I am a girl who codes from Basking Ridge, NJ.
I attend Newark Academy and will be in the 12th grade this fall.
I live at home with my mom, my dad, and my younger sister Jolene.
When I'm not coding, you can find me travelling around!
The following are three destinations I travelled to in the past year.

<strong>Santa Barbara, California:</strong> I attended a research camp here at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I bought my favorite sweatshirt here!

<strong>Puerto Rico:</strong> I came here last winter break and the weather here was amazing. My favorite activity was wandering through the old cityâ€™s remains.

<strong>Cancun, Mexico:</strong> My family travelled here for spring break to enjoy the beach and sun. My favorite activity was swimming in the lagoon.
